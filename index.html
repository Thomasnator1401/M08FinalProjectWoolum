          - My dad and I has lived in the same exact house we live at today
          since back in October 5, 1996. My favorite foods are mac & cheese,
          peanut Butter & jelly sandwiches, rasbperry filled donuts, and etc. My
          favorite drinks are cold water, crystal light lemonade, H-C orange,
          and etc. My house has 23 working computers and 1 computer which don't
          work which we are using for parts. There were 6 computers that were
          inside my house which were recycled at Best Buy.
